# Typing Settings
The Typing Settings add-on developed by Abdallah hayder provides several options to enhance the typing experience on the keyboard through its features. These features include enabling sound effects when typing in text fields, activating or deactivating speak characters through three modes: off, speak characters only in text fields, or speak characters anywhere, including words. It also allows enabling or disabling speak passwords when typing in password fields. <br />

## Add-on Settings and Shortcuts
You can access the typing settings through the menu nvda/Preferences/Settings/Typing Settings. <br />
There, you will find the add-on options, which are as follows: <br />

- Typing Sound: <br />
  Here, we select the desired sound, which will play when pressing characters, numbers, space, and backspace. <br />

- Sounds: <br />
  From here, we can listen to the selected package's voice samples, and we can navigate between them using the arrow keys. <br />

- Character Pronunciation: <br />
  Through this option field, we can choose how characters are pronounced when they are pressed. <br />
  The three methods are as follows: <br />
  - Off: Characters are not pronounced at all. <br />
  - Anywhere: Characters are pronounced when pressed anywhere, whether in text fields or elsewhere. <br />
  - In Text Fields Only: Characters are pronounced only when pressed in writable fields; otherwise, characters are not pronounced. <br />
  You can control these options without entering the NVDA settings by pressing the shortcut NVDA+2. <br />

- Word Pronunciation: <br />
  This option is similar to the previous one but applies to pronouncing words after pressing the space bar. Its options are similar to character pronunciation options, and you can control these options without entering the NVDA settings by pressing NVDA+3. <br />
 <br />
- Play Sounds While Typing:
  When this option is selected, the add-on will play sounds while typing, and when it is deselected, this feature will be disabled. You can control this feature by pressing the shortcut NVDA+Shift+K. <br />

- Password Word Pronunciation: <br />
  When this option is selected, you will be able to hear the characters typed in password fields. You can control this feature using the shortcut NVDA+Shift+P. <br />
#### Version 0.2
#What's new in version 0.2 <br />
Solve the problem of delay in some sounds. <br />
Now it is possible to set a different sound when pressing the enter button. <br />
You can now create sound pack from within the settings. <br />
When you click on Create a new soundpack and write the name, a window will appear with a list containing the sound boxes. You can press Enter on each box and choose the desired sound, then click on Create. The field for the writing sound will be multi-tracked, meaning more than one sound can be added to it by clicking on it. Choose the sound, then repeat the process. <br />
You can now delete a package. After selecting it, press the Tab button until we find Delete and click on it. <br />
Turkish, Vietnamese, Italian, Croatian, and Ukrainian languages ​​have been added. <br />
Some other fixes.
